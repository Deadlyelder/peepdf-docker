# peepdf-docker

[Peepdf]() is developed and maintained by Jose Miguel Esparza, and it's a great tool to investigate PDFs' suspicious elements. It also has an interactive console mode, with the ability to analyse JavaScript and shellcode.
Unforunately, it is a tool that does not work smoothly on macOS and even on some of the Linux systems.

There are some dockers that already have peepdf as container but it does not install the `PyV8` correctly which makes the Javascript analyse module not work smoothly.
